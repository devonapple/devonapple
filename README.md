I’m @devonapple!

I’m a technical writer with experience in healthcare and finance settings, looking for work in the software industry.

I’m interested in comedy, science fiction, role-playing games, and Fallout. I've written and delivered live-action role-playing games for 20 years.

I'm currently working in online finance, improving documentation in JSON and Markdown, using Atom, .git, and GitHub.

I’m looking to collaborate on REST software documentation, Oxygen DITA XML, and games.
