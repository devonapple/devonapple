I’m @devonapple!

I’m a technical writer with documentation experience in the healthcare and finance industries, looking to move into documentation full-time.

I’m interested in comedy, science fiction, role-playing games, and Fallout. I've written and delivered live-action role-playing games for over 20 years.

I'm currently working in online finance, improving documentation in JSON and Markdown, using Atom, .git, and GitHub.

I’m looking to collaborate on REST software documentation, Oxygen DITA XML, and games.
